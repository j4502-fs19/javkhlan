<h1>Welcome to my very first website!</h1>
<h2>I have developed this website for my class Multimedia Planning and Design, which is awesome!</h2>
<p>Feel free to contact me at jb2fn@mail.missouri.edu</p>
<p> Here is my a joke I just found on internet:"A bear walks into a bar and says, "Give me a whiskey and...cola." "Why the big pause?"" asks the bartender. The bear shrugged. "I'm not sure; I was born with them."</p>
<p>My favourite sports are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Football</li>
    <li>Volleyball</li>
      <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Basketball</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
  <li>Alabama</li>
  <li>Georgia</li>
  <li>Mizzou</li>
</ol>
