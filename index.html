      <h1>Welcome to my very first website!</h1>
      <h2>I have developed this website for my class Multimedia Planning and Design, which is awesome!</h2>
      <p>Feel free to contact me at jb2fn@mail.missouri.edu</p>
      <p> Here is my joke: "A bear walks into a bar and says, "Give me a whiskey and...cola." "Why the big pause?"" asks the bartender. The bear shrugged. "I'm not sure; I was born with them."</p>
      <p>My favourite sports are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Swimming</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
          </ul>
